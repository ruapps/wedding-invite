PLACEHOLDER ASSETS
- 'groom.png' is a tiny placeholder image. Replace with your groom portrait: put your image file at public/groom.png (recommended size ~800x800).
- If you have a groom video to use as base, add it to public/groom_base.mp4 (optional). The app will play /groom_base.mp4 when generating invitation.
